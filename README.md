## ðŸš€ Running the Application with Docker

### Option 1: Using Pre-built Images

## ðŸ§° Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Port Conflicts**: If you encounter port conflicts, you may have other services running on the same ports. Stop those services and try again.

- **Network Issues**: Ensure the services can communicate with each other. The `docker-compose.yml` creates a network named `lms-network` for inter-service communication.

- **Database Connection**: If the services can't connect to the database, check your internet connection as the database is hosted on Supabase.

### Viewing Logs

To view logs for **all services**:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
